# Drupal Chess Game Viewer

This module allows you to import a chess game on PGN format into your Drupal site. Games are stored as a new content of type *Chess Game* and are displayed in a board beside its move list.
It works with [PHP Chess Parser](http://www.dhtmlgoodies.com/index.html?whichScript=chess-parser) and [Chessboard.js](http://chessboardjs.com/).
